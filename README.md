# About This Repo
This is a current side project of mine for the purpose of understanding a bit of machine learning, particularly related to computer vision. It is not in working order (yet) and is a passive, long-term project for me. If you find any of this code useful, please feel free to use it.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions, though I won't accept contributions yet since this remains for my learning purposes until further notice. I hope it's interesting to you!
